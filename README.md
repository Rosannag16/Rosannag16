👋 Hi there! I'm @Rosannag16

🚀 Passionate about software development and technology since childhood, I embarked on my journey into the world of IT after completing my linguistic studies. I am determined and proficient in software development, with strong technical and linguistic skills. Recently, I enhanced my skills by completing a full stack developer course, gaining a comprehensive understanding of both front-end and back-end development for web applications. I enjoy brainstorming and turning ideas into reality through my work.

🌱 Currently expanding my knowledge in full stack development, including technologies such as Angular, React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

💬 Let's collaborate on projects aimed at creating robust and user-friendly web applications.

📫 You can reach me via [your preferred contact method].

😄 Pronouns: she/her (if you prefer to use feminine pronouns).

⚡ Fun fact: Designing on the computer brings me tranquility. I find peace and concentration in working on software development projects, creating solutions and seeing my ideas come to life through code.
